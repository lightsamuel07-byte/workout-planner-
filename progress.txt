Progress Snapshot
Date: 2026-02-05

Current Phase
- Phase 4.2 (UX audit + phased recommendation) is complete.
- Phase 4.3 (Phase 1 implementation) is complete for this cycle.
- Phase 4.3 (Phase 2 + Phase 3 refinement) is complete for this cycle.
- Phase 4.3 iterative hardening loop (debug/check/test/refine) is complete for this cycle.
- Phase 4.3 code-quality cleanup loop (dashboard card refactor + tests) is complete for this cycle.

Built (Complete)
- Phase 1: Streamlit shell, shared design system, shared UI helpers.
- Phase 2: Core pages for dashboard, plan generation, plan viewing, logging, progress, weekly review, and exercise history.
- Phase 4.3 refinements:
  - Unified border rhythm and color-token usage across primary pages.
  - Responsive weekly schedule grid on dashboard (desktop/tablet/mobile optimized).
  - Migrated action/navigation buttons to `width="stretch"` patterns (plus legacy compatibility shim in `src/ui_utils.py`).
  - Improved logger readability (visible labels, calmer status surfaces, tokenized notes/log indicators, safer mobile sticky spacing).
  - Softened dense card treatments in plans/progress/history/review/generate flows.
  - Added defensive HTML escaping in plan/review exercise renderers.
  - Removed dashboard traceback noise on temporary Sheets failures.
  - Added parser serialization unit tests for workout logger fields.
  - Refactored dashboard day card markup into shared design-system helper.
  - Added day card rendering/escaping unit tests.

Built (Partially Complete)
- Phase 3: SQLite persistence and import tooling are live; DB status page is live.
- Remaining in Phase 3: broader automated test coverage beyond logger/day-card parsing.

In Progress
- Waiting for user visual feedback on the latest refinement pass.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Collect updated screenshots (mobile/tablet/desktop) after latest refinements.
2. Run one targeted micro-polish pass only on remaining visual outliers from feedback.
3. Expand tests to cover plan parsing + dashboard fallback behaviors.

Progress Snapshot
Date: 2026-02-05

Current Phase
- Phase 4.3 (Apple-style UI refresh) is complete for this cycle.
- Phase 4.3 validation loop (compileall, unit tests, headless Streamlit boot) is complete for this cycle.

Built (Complete)
- Apple-style design token refresh in `src/design_system.py` and `assets/styles.css`.
- New design-system snapshot: `DESIGN_SYSTEM_2026-02-05_2219.md` (apple refresh; prior doc preserved).
- Global CSS restyle: removed ripple/hover lifts, flattened shadows, blue accent, updated focus ring.
- Emoji removal across headers, navigation, CTAs, and section titles; day cards now hide emoji when empty.
- Day card refinement: tighter typography and monochrome completion markers.
- HTML rendering safety: left-aligned HTML blocks via `strip()` to prevent code-block rendering.
- Updated primary pages to new border/radius rhythm and neutral styling (dashboard, generate, plans, logger, progress, review, history).

In Progress
- Waiting for user visual feedback on the Apple-style refresh.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Capture updated screenshots (mobile/tablet/desktop, light/dark).
2. Run a micro-polish pass on any remaining visual outliers from feedback.
