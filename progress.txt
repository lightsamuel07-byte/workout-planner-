Current Phase
- Phase 3 reliability hardening: post-live-output Fort test-week cleanup.

Built (Complete)
- Addressed live-output parser drift in test-week conversion:
  - blocked long all-caps narrative lines from section matching in `src/fort_compiler.py`,
  - stripped `COMPLETE` prefixes from section headers before classification (`COMPLETE GARAGE ...` normalization),
  - expanded instruction-noise filtering (`TIPS`, `Rest ...`, `Right into...`, `Hip Circle is optional`) so these lines do not become anchors.
- Improved Fort fidelity alias behavior:
  - expected variant anchors can match explicit swap alias targets (e.g., Bulgarian split squat variant suffixes),
  - retained anti-overbroad matching guard.
- Strengthened generation/correction instructions in `src/plan_generator.py`:
  - explicitly forbids non-exercise instructional/section text as exercise rows.
- Expanded parser regression tests in `tests/test_fort_compiler.py` for all above cases.

Validation Run
- `python3 -m unittest tests/test_fort_compiler.py -v` passed (15 tests).
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` passed (37 tests).
- `python3 -m compileall pages src tests main.py` passed.
- Targeted smoke parsing confirmed clean anchor extraction for test-week snippets (no instruction noise rows).

In Progress
- Awaiting new live generation run after this patch to confirm unresolved violations drop and anchor insertions normalize.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Re-run test-week generation and inspect `AI Generation Summary` and Mon/Wed/Fri rows.
2. If unresolved violations remain, capture exact violation codes/messages and add code-level deterministic repair for those codes.

Current Phase
- Phase 3 reliability hardening: Fort test-week parser/fidelity compatibility.

Built (Complete)
- Hardened Fort parser in `src/fort_compiler.py` for one-week testing cycles:
  - Added section recognition for test-week headers:
    - `1RM TEST` / `3RM TEST` -> strength work
    - `TARGETED WARM-UP` -> prep/mobility
    - `GARAGE ... TEST` and modality benchmark test headers -> conditioning
    - `MAX PULL UP TEST` / `MAX PUSH-UP TEST` -> strength work
  - Added conditioning-header anchor seeding so benchmark headers (e.g., `GARAGE - 2K BIKEERG`) are preserved as exercise anchors.
  - Added non-exercise instruction filtering in Fort parsing (`TIPS`, `Rest ...`, `Right into...`, etc.) to prevent noisy anchor insertion.
  - Expanded alias matching for Fort fidelity with canonicalized alias keys:
    - swap directives like `Split Squat -> Heel-Elevated Goblet Squat` now satisfy anchors such as `DB SPLIT SQUAT` during fidelity checks.
  - Tightened alias canonicalization to prevent overbroad split-squat swap matching:
    - generic split-squat anchors no longer incorrectly accept unrelated variant-only swap targets (e.g., `Forward Split Squat -> Leg Extension`).
- Added Fort hardening regression tests in `tests/test_fort_compiler.py`:
  - test-week section parsing/anchor extraction
  - instruction-line filtering from section anchors
  - split-squat swap alias fidelity behavior
  - split-squat alias overbreadth guard behavior
- Hardened generation prompt constraints in `src/plan_generator.py`:
  - explicitly forbids section/instruction lines from being output as exercise rows in both initial generation and correction prompts.

Validation Run
- `python3 -m unittest tests/test_fort_compiler.py -v` passed (12 tests).
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` passed (34 tests).
- `python3 -m compileall pages src tests main.py` passed.
- Targeted parser smoke check against provided `2/23`, `2/25`, `2/27` Fort test-week text:
  - extracted expected prep/strength/backoff/conditioning/aux sections,
  - no misclassification of `1RM TEST` as exercise.

In Progress
- Awaiting live test-week generation run in Streamlit Cloud to confirm end-to-end output quality.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Generate test-week plan with your provided Fort inputs and inspect `AI Generation Summary`.
2. If unresolved fidelity violations remain, implement deterministic section-specific prescription hydration from parsed Fort set/rep/load rows.

Current Phase
- Phase 3 reliability hardening: improvement-loop follow-up (generation quality + context efficiency).

Built (Complete)
- Generation fidelity hardening:
  - Fort validator now flags deterministic placeholder anchors with code `fort_placeholder_prescription`.
  - This keeps placeholder repairs from silently shipping as final output.
- DB generation context hardening:
  - Added character-budget control (`max_chars`) to constrain prompt payload growth.
  - Added explicit truncation message and safe fallback when budget is too small.
  - Added source tags to context lines: `[FORT]`, `[PRIOR]`, `[HISTORY]`.
- Streamlit integration:
  - `pages/generate_plan.py` now passes DB context budget from config (`database.context_max_chars`, default 2200).
- Tests expanded and updated:
  - `tests/test_fort_compiler.py` for placeholder-prescription signal.
  - `tests/test_generation_context.py` for budget and source-tag behavior.

Validation Run
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` passed (30 tests).
- `python3 -m compileall pages src tests main.py` passed.
- `python3 scripts/run_quality_cycles.py --cycles 100 --print-every 25 --step-timeout-sec 180 --xlsx-path "/Users/samuellight/Downloads/Workouts.xlsx" --backtest-limit 8`
  - Completed: `100/100`, Passed: `True`
  - Backtest aggregate score: `95.0`

In Progress
- Awaiting live-generation output check from Streamlit Cloud with newest Fort inputs to verify placeholder violations resolve in-model without residual unresolved count.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Run live generation and inspect `AI Generation Summary` for `fort_placeholder_prescription` residuals.
2. If residual placeholder violations persist, add deterministic section-specific prescription hydration using parsed Fort set/rep fields.

  - `python3 scripts/run_quality_cycles.py --cycles 400 --print-every 100 --step-timeout-sec 180 --xlsx-path "/Users/samuellight/Downloads/Workouts.xlsx" --backtest-limit 8`
  - Completed: `400/400`, Passed: `True`
  - Timeout events: `0`
  - Cycle duration: min `0.361s`, avg `0.384s`, max `0.495s`
- Backtest result (post-loop): Aggregate score `95.0`

In Progress
- Awaiting next live-generation run from Streamlit Cloud to evaluate production behavior against stress-test baseline.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Trigger a live plan generation and confirm `AI Generation Summary` remains stable (`Unresolved violations: 0` target).
2. If generation drifts in live runs, use the new cycle runner timeout/reporting to isolate the first failing cycle with artifact capture.

- Integrated deterministic repair + validation-first flow in `src/plan_generator.py`.
  - Post-generation order: swaps -> DB parity -> hold-lock apply -> range collapse -> validator -> deterministic repair -> optional correction prompt.

Current Phase
- Phase 3 reliability hardening: post-implementation audit pass and bug tightening.

Built (Complete)
- Fixed DB parity edge case:
  - Dumbbell squat/press variants are now still enforced as even loads.
  - Main barbell lifts remain exempt from DB parity logic.
  - Files: `src/plan_generator.py`, `src/plan_validator.py`, `tests/test_plan_validator.py`.
- Fixed CLI output path handling in `main.py`:
  - `save_plan()` tuple is now unpacked and both plan/explanation paths print correctly.
- Hardened test script behavior:
  - Converted `test_format_prompt.py` and `test_compressed_prompt.py` to explicit `main()` scripts with no import-time API calls.
  - This prevents hangs during broad discovery/audit commands.

Validation Run
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` passed (17 tests).
- `python3 -m compileall app.py pages src tests test_format_prompt.py test_compressed_prompt.py test_sheets_writer.py main.py` passed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -p "test_*.py" -v` now exits cleanly (no hangs; no tests in repo root by design).

In Progress
- Awaiting user run of next-week generation in Streamlit Cloud with latest hardening.

Blocked
- No technical blockers.

Next
1. Generate the next-week plan using the provided Fort inputs.
2. Verify the sheet includes `AI Generation Summary` with both validation and explanation text.
3. Confirm no odd DB loads appear outside barbell main-lift blocks.

  - Mixed note signals across multiple grips are treated as ambiguous and ignored for repeat checks.
  - Day-level grip detection now scans day curl entries until a valid grip is found.
- Added regression test in `tests/test_plan_validator.py` to ensure notes containing cross-day grip text do not trigger `biceps_grip_repeat`.

Validation Run
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` passed (19 tests).
- `python3 -m compileall src/plan_validator.py tests/test_plan_validator.py` passed.
