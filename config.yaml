# ATHLETE PROFILE
# ============================================================================
athlete:
  name: "Samuel"
  units: "metric"
  spelling: "American"

# ============================================================================
# GOALS & FOCUS AREAS
# ============================================================================
goals:
  primary: "strength + aesthetics"
  focus_areas:
    - "arms"
    - "medial delts"
    - "upper chest"
    - "back detail"
  training_philosophy: "Maximize aesthetics without ever interfering with Mon/Wed/Fri Fort program"
  approach: "Progressive overload every session"

  # Explicit aesthetic objective for Claude — used in prompt generation
  aesthetic_objective: |
    Target physique: strength-first, visibly muscular. Think broader shoulders, bigger arms,
    upper-chest shelf, upper-back density. Priority order for supplemental volume:
      1. Arms — biceps shape + triceps fullness (HIGH)
      2. Delts — medial delt cap for width, rear delt for 3D look (HIGH)
      3. Upper chest — clavicular pec "pop", incline pressing/fly patterns (HIGH)
      4. Back detail — upper-back density, rear-delt tie-in, posture (HIGH)
    Aesthetics cannot blunt main-lift performance. Stimulus-efficient hypertrophy only.

  visual_outcome:
    - "Broader-looking shoulders (medial delt cap)"
    - "More arm presence from front/side views (biceps + triceps)"
    - "Upper chest shelf — incline pressing and fly patterns"
    - "Upper-back/rear-delt density for posture and finished look"

# REFERENCE 1RMs

# WEEKLY STRUCTURE
# ============================================================================
weekly_structure:
  main_days:
    - "Monday"
    - "Wednesday"
    - "Friday"
  main_days_note: "Run Fort workouts exactly as written for that cycle"

  supplemental_days:
    - "Tuesday"
    - "Thursday"
    - "Saturday"
  supplemental_days_note: "Aesthetics + incline walking; must NOT compromise next main day"

  daily_warmup: "McGill Big-3 at top of every day"

  finishers:
    incline_walk: true
    thaw_intensity_note: "THAW intensity must preserve next day performance"

  sauna: "Include after all days when appropriate"

# ============================================================================
# HARD PREFERENCES & RULES
# ============================================================================
hard_rules:
  equipment:
    - "No belt on pulls"
    - "Standing calf raises only (NEVER seated)"
    - "No split squats (any variant — includes Bulgarian, rear-foot elevated, forward split)"
    - "DB loads: even numbers only (2 kg increments — never odd kg)"

  biceps:
    - "Never same-grip two days in a row on supplemental days"
    - "Rotate grips: supinated → neutral → pronated"
    - "Keep ≥48h between long-length stimuli (e.g., incline curls)"
    - "Cap biceps hard sets at 10-12 per rolling 4 days"
    - "Biceps work must be planned as a system across Tue/Thu/Sat — not day-by-day in isolation"

  triceps:
    - "Tuesday: rope attachment (elbow-friendly)"
    - "Friday: straight-bar or heavier loading"
    - "Saturday: varied — NOT single-arm D-handle (disliked)"
    - "Do not repeat the same triceps pattern mindlessly across Tue/Fri/Sat"

  delts:
    - "No redundant lateral delt overlap on back-to-back days"
    - "If Monday Fort already included DB lateral raises, Tuesday defaults to rear-delt / scapular hygiene instead"
    - "Reason: protects Wednesday bench performance and avoids redundant local fatigue"

  carries:
    - "Carries on Tuesday only (not Thursday or Saturday)"
    - "Moderate load — RPE 6-7 max — to preserve Friday deadlift grip"
    - "Use kettlebells (never dumbbells) for carries"

  interference_protection:
    tuesday: "Protect Wednesday bench — no heavy chest/triceps/front-delt loading, no barbell pressing"
    thursday: "Protect Friday deadlift — no loaded carries, no heavy rows, no heavy biceps (>6 hard sets), no grip-fatiguing work"
    saturday: "Protect Monday squat / overall recovery — no heavy lower back, no spinal fatigue, no junk volume"

  spelling: "American spelling only"

# ============================================================================
# PROGRESSION RULES
# ============================================================================
progression:
  barbell_main_lifts:
    rule: "If last top set ≤ RPE 9 (≥1 RIR), add ~2.5-5 kg next time or add 1-2 reps within range"
    rounding: "Nearest 0.5 kg"

  dumbbells:
    rule: "Move up one DB step after hitting top of rep range on ≥2 sets clean; otherwise add reps"
    rounding: "Nearest available step"

  cable_machine:
    rule: "When top of range is clean with prescribed tempo/pauses, add one plate next session; otherwise add reps"

  - "No same-grip biceps on consecutive days"
  - "Biceps hard sets ≤ 10-12 per rolling 4 days"
  - "Standing calf raises only"
  - "Triceps attachments varied across Tue/Fri/Sat; no single-arm D-handle on Sat"
  - "No split squats anywhere"
  - "Carries placed Tuesday at moderate load to preserve Friday grip"
  - "THAW intensity won't trash the next main day"
  - "Sauna included after main days when appropriate"
