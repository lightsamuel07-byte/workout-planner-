  incline_walk: "3.5 mph @ 6-7%"

# Recovery protocols

# Hard preferences
hard_preferences:
  - "No belt on pulls"
  - "Standing calf raises only (never seated)"
  - "No split squats (any variant)"
  - "Carries on Tuesday by default; load = moderate to preserve Friday deadlift grip"
  - "American spelling only"

# Lateral raise guardrail
lateral_raise_rule: "If Monday Fort included DB lateral raises or any lateral-delt-dominant movement, do NOT program DB lateral raises on Tuesday. Instead use rear-delt or scapular hygiene work (e.g., reverse pec deck, cable Y-raise, rear-delt face pulls). This protects Wednesday bench and prevents redundant local fatigue."

# Triceps attachment rotation (strict)
triceps_rules:
  tuesday: "rope only (elbow-friendly — low joint stress)"
  friday: "straight-bar or heavier loading (can push load here)"
  saturday: "varied angle/implement — NOT single-arm D-handle (disliked). Options: EZ-bar, V-bar, overhead rope, close-grip push-up variation."
  rule: "Do not repeat the same triceps attachment on consecutive days. Vary across the week."

# Biceps rules (strict system — plan across all three days together, not day-by-day)
biceps_rules:
  - "Never same-grip two days in a row on supplemental days (Tue/Thu/Sat)"
  - "Rotate grips: supinated → neutral → pronated (in that order across the week)"
  - "Keep ≥48h between long-length stimuli (incline curls, spider curls, etc.)"
  - "Cap biceps hard sets at 10-12 per rolling 4 days"
  - "Plan biceps as a system: decide Tue/Thu/Sat grips before writing any single day"

# Delt programming rules
delt_rules:
  - "Medial delts: priority target — include cable or DB lateral raise variation at least twice per week"
  - "Rear delts: include at least once per week (face pulls, reverse pec deck, cable Y-raise)"
  - "No back-to-back lateral delt loading — if Mon had laterals, Tue gets rear-delt instead"
  - "Shoulder work must be distributed intelligently across the week around bench and Fort auxiliaries"

# Saturday-specific rules
saturday_rules:
  - "Upper body only"
  - "Arms + delts + upper chest are the priority"
  - "No heavy lower back, no heavy leg compounds, no spinal fatigue"
  - "No single-arm D-handle triceps pressdowns (disliked)"
  - "Grip on biceps must differ from Thursday's grip"
